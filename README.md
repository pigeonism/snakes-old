# snakes-old

This was made to test out snakes using python and pygame. 
It has no levels or power ups and uses the arrow keys.

With both modules in the same directory, run a_autosnake.py. b_autosnake is for cheats like going through the lines. 
This could be used later for power ups if they are added.

Requires python3-pygame
